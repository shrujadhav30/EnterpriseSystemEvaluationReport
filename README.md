# EnterpriseSystemEvaluationReport
Fitter Snacker is an Australian snacker bar manufacturer. Currently the company is operating under 8 separate database systems, which means departments including sales, accounting and warehouse could not instantly access the data from each other.
Therefore, not only much extra data updating workload has been created, but also constant failures may occur to both external and internal business activities. With the idea to upgrade the current legacy systems, Fitter Snacker came to this team for a comprehensive evaluation for a new ERP implementation project, which includes both the evaluation of current systems as well as the recommendation to the suitable ERP vendor and software.
Identifying the historical failures, organisational structure as well as the current business process pattern of Fitter Snacker, Microsoft Dynamics 365 is reviewed as the most suitable choice for this business. This software is cloud based and includes multiple selectable components, which could potentially act as the precise match to this companies addressed problems and business strategy. Moreover, since the components can be purchased individually, the overall cost should be most reasonable price. Moreover, in consideration of this companyâ€™s pursuit on future consistency of their software, SAP and its business network policy is also reviewed as an alternative in this evaluation.
